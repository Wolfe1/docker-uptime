docker-uptime
=============

A dockerized [Uptime](https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime) Container

## Usage

```
# Run MongoDB
docker run -d --name mongodb mongo

# Run Uptime and link MongoDB
docker run -d -p 8082:8082 --name uptime --link mongodb:mongodb -i -t usman/docker-uptime

# Run Uptime and link MongoDB with custom Database Password
docker run -d -p 8082:8082 --name uptime --link mongodb:mongodb -i -t usman/docker-uptime <DB Password>
```
Then point your browser at [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/)

or [http://192.168.59.103:8082/](http://192.168.59.103:8082/) if you are using boot2docker

## Custom Initilization Script

If you would like to run a custom intilization script to setup environment before uptime is run please create a shell script called init-uptime.sh and load it into container at __/tmp/uptime__ using the volume switch.

```
# Create Script
mkdir uptime
vim uptime/init-uptime.sh

# Mount Script into uptime container
docker run -d -p 8082:8082 --name uptime --link mongodb:mongodb -v uptime:/tmp/uptime -i -t usman/docker-uptime
```

## Custom Configuration

If you would like to use custom configuration please create config files and load it into container at __/tmp/uptime/config/__ using the volume switch. You can use [default.yaml](https://github.com/techtraits/docker-uptime/blob/master/default.yaml) as a base for your custom config. Note that unless you have your own mongo instance please leave the MONGO_SERVER and MONGO_PASSWORD keywords intact so they can be replaced by the setup scripts. 

```
# Create Config
mkdir -p uptime/config
vim uptime/config/default.yaml

# Mount Script into uptime container
docker run -d -p 8082:8082 --name uptime --link mongodb:mongodb -v uptime:/tmp/uptime -i -t usman/docker-uptime
```

## Building

To build the image, simply invoke

    docker build github.com/techtraits/docker-uptime

A prebuilt container is also available in the docker index
